COSC1187 - Interactive 3D Graphics & Animation
Semester A 2017
Lecturer & Coordinator: Geoff Leach

Student Name: Mai Nguyen
Student ID  : s3558475

------------------------------------
Compile & run:
------------------------------------

- go to the directory containing the submission files
- to compile, type: make
- to run    , type: ./s3558475

------------------------------------
Implemented features:
------------------------------------

- perform sphere-sphere collision detection with the cars
- perform point-rectangle collision detection with the logs

- add a road, along with a road texture
- add a river, including a texture for the river bed, and transparent water

- draw a hierarchical model for the frog, made from boxes.
- draw a hierarchical model for the car, made from boxes and cylinders

- perform keyframe animation for the prepare stage of a frog's jump
- perform keyframe animation for jumping and landing animation
- perform keyframe animation for ribbit animation

- implement a working game with game scoring and player's lives
- add an OSD which shows:
	+ frame rate and time per frame
	+ score and player's lives
	+ game over

- draw sky box

- implement exploding (3D) using a particle system
